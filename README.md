# Game Assistant
Our AI Game Jam project to automate game-lore generation. Features a front-end webpage that is rendered via Flask to prompt users for information about their game so we can create the description, some characters and images.

## Running Game Assistant
1. Set your openai key:
```
export OPENAI_KEY=<your_openai_key>
```
or if you're on Windows use:
```
set OPENAI_KEY=<your_openai_key>
```
2. Run all commands below by pasting into your terminal and hitting enter.

3. Go to [localhost](http://localhost:80).

## Future On-Demand Content Automation

Future work could include packages which are able to generate protos that can be consumed by a generic application to communicate back and forth with LLMs. This would allow any game engine to create content on-demand, such as new characters, items and quests.
